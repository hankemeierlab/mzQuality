\title{Create a SummarizedExperiment Object from a Long Dataframe}
\usage{
buildExperiment(
  df,
  compoundColumn = "compound",
  aliquotColumn = "aliquot",
  primaryAssay = "area",
  secondaryAssay = "area_is",
  typeColumn = "type",
  qc = "SQC",
  secondaryIndex = "compound_is"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe in a long format. Should contain at least a column for
compounds, aliquots, area, type, and datetime. See the vignette for an
example of a valid dataframe.}

\item{compoundColumn}{The column name in `df` that should be used for
compounds. Defaults to 'compound'.}

\item{aliquotColumn}{The column name in `df` that should be used for
aliquots. Defaults to 'aliquot'.}

\item{primaryAssay}{The column name in `df` that represents the area or
intensities of measured compounds. Defaults to 'area'.}

\item{secondaryAssay}{The column name in `df` that represents the area or
intensities of measured internal standards. If no internal standards are
present, this parameter can be omitted, and the A/IS ratio will
be set to 1.}

\item{typeColumn}{The column name in `df` that specifies the type of each
sample (e.g., 'SAMPLE', 'QC'). Defaults to 'type'.}

\item{qc}{The name of the QC sample used for batch correction found in the
'type' column of `df`. Defaults to 'SQC'.}

\item{secondaryIndex}{The column name in `df` that should be used for
internal standard compounds. Defaults to 'compound_is'.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with dimensions compounds x aliquots.
}
\description{
mzQuality works with a SummarizedExperiment object to perform
  its analysis. This function aids in that process by constructing one for
  you. It uses cardinality to identify in which slot a column should be
  stored. After creation, it will validate if the object is suitable for
  mzQuality to use.
