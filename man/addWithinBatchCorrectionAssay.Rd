\usage{
addWithinBatchCorrectionAssay(
  exp,
  assayName = "ratio",
  saveAssay = "ratio_corrected",
  qcType = metadata(exp)$QC,
  removeOutliers = TRUE,
  withinBatchNonNA = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A `SummarizedExperiment` object containing metabolomics data
with `colData` columns: `batch`, `order`, `type`, and `injection_time`.}

\item{assayName}{Character string specifying the name of the assay to
correct (default is "ratio").}

\item{saveAssay}{Character string specifying the name of the new assay to
store corrected values (default is "ratio_corrected").}

\item{qcType}{Character string specifying the sample type used for QC
(usually "SQC" or "QC"). Defaults to the value stored in
`metadata(exp)$QC`.}

\item{removeOutliers}{Logical, whether to remove outliers during batch
correction. Defaults to `FALSE`}

\item{withinBatchNonNA}{Integer specifying the minimum number of
non-NA values before a correction is applied (default is 3).}
}
\value{
A `SummarizedExperiment` object with a new assay containing
  the drift-corrected values.
}
\description{
Applies within-batch signal correction to assay data based
  on QC sample drift using a linear model per feature.
}
\details{
This function corrects for within-batch signal drift in
  metabolomics data by fitting a linear model to quality control (QC)
  samples across the injection order within each batch. Outliers in the
  QC measurements at the beginning and end of each batch can optionally
  be removed before model fitting. The correction is applied to the
  target assay by dividing the original intensities by the predicted
  values and rescaling using the median QC intensities.
