\title{Calculate Concentrations for a Full Experiment}
\usage{
calculateConcentrations(
  exp,
  calibrationLineTypes = metadata(exp)$concentration,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A SummarizedExperiment object containing the experimental data.}

\item{calibrationLineTypes}{A character vector specifying the calibration
line types to use for concentration calculations. Defaults to the
concentration given in the metadata of the experiment}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the `batchConcentrations` function.}
}
\value{
A SummarizedExperiment object with predicted concentrations
  stored in the assay specified by `saveAssay` (default: `"concentration"`).
  Additional metadata is added to `rowData`, including R² values, residuals,
  outliers, linear ranges, and calibration ratios.
}
\description{
This function calculates predicted concentrations for all
  compounds in a SummarizedExperiment object. It processes each batch
  individually, aggregates results, and updates the experiment object
  with calculated concentrations and associated metadata.
}
\details{
The function computes concentrations for each batch in the
  experiment using the `batchConcentrations` function. It aggregates
  results such as R² values, residuals, outliers, linear ranges, and
  calibration ratios. The function also evaluates the reportability of
  compounds based on RSD, linearity, and linear range thresholds.
  Concentrations below zero are replaced with `NA`.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Load example dataset
exp <- readRDS(system.file(package = "mzQuality", "data.RDS"))

# Calculate concentrations
exp <- calculateConcentrations(exp)

# Access the calculated concentrations
assay(exp, "concentration")
