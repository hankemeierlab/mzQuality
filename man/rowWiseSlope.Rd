\title{Calculate the slope of a regression line by row}
\usage{
rowWiseSlope(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix of X-values.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix of Y-values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the row-wise slope values.
}
\description{
Computes the row-wise slope of a simple linear regression model,
where each row represents an independent dataset.
}
\details{
The function calculates the slope as the ratio of the row-wise
covariance of `x` and `y` to the row-wise covariance of `x` with itself.
This follows the standard linear regression formula:
`slope = Cov(x, y) / Cov(x, x)`.
