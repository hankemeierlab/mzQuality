\title{Calculate row-wise correlation (R-squared)}
\usage{
rowCorrelation(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix or data frame.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix or data frame with the same dimensions as `x`.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the row-wise R-squared values.
}
\description{
Computes the row-wise correlation (R-squared) between two
    matrices or data frames.
}
\details{
This function calculates the row-wise correlation (R-squared)
    values between corresponding rows of two matrices or data frames. It
    subtracts the row means from each element, computes the dot product
    between the rows, and normalizes by the product of the row-wise
    standard deviations.

    Non-finite values in the result (e.g., due to division by zero) are
    replaced with `NA`.

\examples{
x <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 5)
y <- matrix(rnorm(20), nrow = 5)
rowCorrelation(x, y)
