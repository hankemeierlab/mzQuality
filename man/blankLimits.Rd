\title{Add limits of Blank, Detection and Quantification with Concentrations}
\usage{
blankLimits(exp, type = "PROC", assay = "concentration")
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{A SummarizedExperiment object}

\item{type}{Name of the sample type representing processed blanks,
defaults to 'PROC'}

\item{assay}{Name of the assay to use for the calculation, defaults to
'concentration'}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment with 3 added columns in the rowData slot
called "LoB" (Limit of Blank), "LoD" (Limit of Detection), and "LoQ"
(Limit of Quantification)
}
\description{
The Limit of Blank (LoB), -Detection (LoD) and -Quantification
(LoQ) are metrics used to determine if the calculated absolute
quantification is reliable. Compounds with calculated concentrations that
approach these limits might be unreliable. The LoB represent the 95%
percentile of the Blank samples, the LoD represents the limit where a
compound can reliably be detected. The LoQ represents the limit where a
compound can reliably be quantified. The results of the LoB, LoD, and LoQ
are stored in the rowData of the experiment.

# Add concentrations

# Perform analysis

# Model concentrations
