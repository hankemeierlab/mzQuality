\title{Studentized residuals}
\usage{
studentResiduals(residuals, n, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{Matrix of residuals where each row is one compound and
the each column is an observation from the training set. This is usually
a CAL or ACAL line}

\item{n}{Number of observations. Should be equal to the amount of non-NA
values in the training set.}

\item{k}{Number of predictors. Here it is always 1}
}
\value{
Matrix of t-distributed residuals
}
\description{
Studentized residuals represent t-distributed residuals,
meaning that each residual is scored according to the t-distribution.
This allows for determining outliers in regression lines
}
\details{
This function effectively calculates the studentized residuals without
recalculating the model. The basic idea is to delete the observations one at
a time, each time refitting the regression model on the remaining nâ€“1
observations. Then, we compare the observed response values to their
fitted values based on the models with the ith observation deleted. This
produces deleted residuals. Standardizing the deleted residuals produces
studentized residuals.
