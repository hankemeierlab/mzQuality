\title{Create a dynamic mzQuality summary report}
\usage{
summaryReport(
  exp,
  folder,
  output = "mzquality-report.html",
  plots = c("Aliquot", "PCA", "QC"),
  assays = c("ratio", "ratio_corrected")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{SummarizedExperiment object containing the experiment data.}

\item{folder}{Character string specifying the output directory for the
report.}

\item{output}{File name for the HTML output. Defaults to
"mzquality-report.html".}

\item{plots}{Character vector of plots to include in the report. Supported:
"Aliquot", "PCA", "QC".}

\item{assays}{Character vector specifying which assays in `exp` to include.
Only existing assay names will be used.}
}
\value{
An interactive HTML report is saved to the specified `folder`.
}
\description{
Generates an interactive HTML report summarizing the full
    experiment across all compounds. Includes plots such as heatmaps, PCA
    plots, and quality control (QC) visualizations to help evaluate batch
    effects, sample distributions, and analytical variation.
}
\details{
This report helps to assess the overall quality of the experiment
    and offers a visual overview of sample-level patterns across selected
    assays. The plots are rendered interactively (via Plotly) for easier
    exploration and interpretation.
