\title{Calculate the intercept of a regression line by row}
\usage{
.rowWiseIntercept(x, y, slope)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix of X-values.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix of Y-values.}

\item{slope}{A numeric vector of slopes, typically obtained from
[.rowWiseSlope].}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the row-wise intercept values.
}
\description{
Computes the row-wise intercept of a simple linear regression model,
where each row represents an independent dataset.
}
\details{
The function calculates the intercept using the standard formula:
`intercept = mean(y) - slope * mean(x)`, applied row-wise. The slope
values should be computed using [.rowWiseSlope].
