\title{Calculate covariance by row}
\usage{
rowWiseCov(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix of X-values.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix of Y-values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the row-wise covariance values.
}
\description{
This function computes the covariance for each row of two matrices,
handling missing values appropriately. It calculates the pairwise
covariance between corresponding rows of `x` and `y`.
}
\details{
The function removes `NA` values from each row-wise computation and
applies the standard covariance formula with an unbiased estimator
(dividing by `n-1`). If a row has less than two non-NA values,
the covariance is set to `NA` to prevent division errors.
